      # note: options for number-sections and toc not working for htmls, 
      # also modification to before-body.tex partial to add page after abstract 
      # does not appear to have any effect
      # how to define auto word count like in aspr-submission.cls and connect that to YAML header
      # how to add other elements of affiliaiton like address of institution?
